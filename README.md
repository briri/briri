### @briri

Hi, I'm Brian, a Rails developer currently working as the technical lead for the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org), a site that helps researchers author data management plans, and the [DMPHub](https://github.com/CDLUC3/dmphub) which registers DMP IDs (persistent identifiers) for data management plans. I'm also a lead contributor to the [DMPRoadmap/roadmap](https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap) open source project (the basis of the DMPTool).
