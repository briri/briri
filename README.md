### @briri

Hi, I'm Brian, a programmer analyst currently working as the technical lead for the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org), a site that helps researchers author data management plans, and the [DMPHub](https://github.com/CDLUC3/dmphub) which registers DMP IDs (persistent identifiers) for data management plans. 

#### Languages
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Ruby, Rails, React, DynamoDB, MySQL and the AWS stack using CloudFormation to manage infrastructure.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the concepts of LLMs and AI. I'm hoping to train an LLM so that it is focused on research data management and then integrate it into aspects of the systems I currently support.
